# Glossary {#glossary}

**abandonware**<a id="abandonware"></a>
:   Software that is no longer being maintained.

**absolute error**<a id="absolute_error"></a>
:   The absolute value of the difference between the observed and the correct value. Absolute error is usually less useful than \gref{relative error}{relative_error}.

**absolute import**<a id="absolute_import"></a>
:   In Python, an import that specifies the full location of the file to be imported.

**absolute path**<a id="absolute_path"></a>
:   A path that points to the same location in the \gref{filesystem}{filesystem} regardless of where it is evaluated. An absolute path is the equivalent of latitude and longitude in geography. See also: [relative path](#relative_path)

**actual result (of test)**<a id="actual_result"></a>
:   The value generated by running code in a test. If this matches the \gref{expected result}{expected_result}, the test \gref{passes}{pass_test}; if the two are different, the test \gref{fails}{fail_test}.

**agile development**<a id="agile"></a>
:   A software development methodology that emphasizes lots of small steps and continuous feedback instead of up-front planning and long-term scheduling. \gref{Exploratory programming}{exploratory_programming} is often agile.

**ally**<a id="ally"></a>
:   Someone who actively promotes and supports inclusivity.

**append mode**<a id="append_mode"></a>
:   To add data to the end of an existing file instead of overwriting the previous contents of that file. Overwriting is the default, so most programming languages require programs to be explicit about wanting to append instead.

**assertion**<a id="assertion"></a>
:   A \gref{Boolean}{boolean} expression that must be \gref{true}{true} at a certain point in a program. Assertions may be built into the language (e.g., \gref{Python}{python}'s `assert` statement) or provided as functions (e.g., \gref{R}{r_language}'s `stopifnot`). They are often used in testing, but are also put in \gref{production code}{production_code} to check that it is behaving correctly. In many languages, assertions should not be used to perform data validation as they may be silently dropped by compilers and interpreters under optimization conditions. Using assertions for data validation can therefore introduce security risks. Unlike many languages, R does not have an `assert` statement which can be disabled, and so use of a \gref{package}{package} such as `assertr` for data validation does not create security holes.

**authentic task**<a id="authentic_task"></a>
:   A task which contains important elements of things that learners would do in real life (non-classroom situations).

**automatic variable**<a id="automatic_variable"></a>
:   A variable that is automatically given a value in a \gref{build rule}{build_rule}. For example, Make automatically assigns the name of a rule's \gref{target}{build_target} to the automatic variable `$@`. Automatic variables are frequently used when writing \gref{pattern rules}{pattern_rule}. See also: [Makefile](#makefile)

**boilerplate**<a id="boilerplate"></a>
:   Standard text that is included in legal contracts, licenses, and so on.

**branch-per-feature workflow**<a id="branch_per_feature_workflow"></a>
:   A common strategy for managing work with \gref{Git}{git} and other \gref{version control systems}{version_control_system} in which a separate \gref{branch}{git_branch} is created for work on each new feature or each \gref{bug}{bug} fix and merged when that work is completed. This isolates changes from one another until they are completed.

**bug report**<a id="bug_report"></a>
:   A collection of files, \gref{logs}{log}, or related information that describes either an unexpected output of some code or program, or an unexpected error or warning. This information is used to help find and fix a \gref{bug}{bug} in the program or code.

:   A system that tracks and manages \gref{reported bugs}{bug_report} for a software program, to make it easier to address and fix the \gref{bugs}{bug}.

**build manager**<a id="build_manager"></a>
:   A program that keeps track of how files depend on one another and runs commands to update any files that are out-of-date. Build managers were invented to \gref{compile}{compile} only those parts of programs that had changed, but are now often used to implement workflows in which plots depend on results files, which in turn depend on raw data files or configuration files. See also: [build rule](#build_rule), [Makefile](#makefile)

**build recipe**<a id="build_recipe"></a>
:   The part of a \gref{build rule}{build_rule} that describes how to update something that has fallen out-of-date.

**build rule**<a id="build_rule"></a>
:   A specification for a \gref{build manager}{build_manager} that describes how some files depend on others and what to do if those files are out-of-date.

**build target**<a id="build_target"></a>
:   The file(s) that a \gref{build rule}{build_rule} will update if they are out-of-date compared to their \gref{dependencies}{dependency}. See also: [Makefile](#makefile), [default target](#default_target)

:   A set of instructions designed to be executed efficiently by an \gref{interpreter}{interpreter}.

**call stack**<a id="call_stack"></a>

**catch (an exception)**<a id="catch_exception"></a>
:   To accept responsibility for handling an error or other unexpected event. \gref{R}{r_language} prefers "handling a condition" to "catching an exception." \gref{Python}{python}, on the other hand, encourages raising and catching exceptions, and in some situations, requires it.

**Creative Commons license**<a id="cc_license"></a>
:   A set of \gref{licenses}{license} that can be applied to published work. Each license is formed by concatenating one or more of `-BY` (Attribution): users must cite the original source; `-SA` (ShareAlike): users must share their own work under a similar license; `-NC` (NonCommercial): work may not be used for commercial purposes without the creator's permission; `-ND` (NoDerivatives): no derivative works (e.g., translations) can be created without the creator's permission. Thus, `CC-BY-NC` means "users must give attribution and cannot use commercially without permission." The term `CC-0` (zero, not letter 'O') is sometimes used to mean "no restrictions," i.e., the work is in the public domain.
